# React-Redux-Template

I find the templates for React & Redux are way too complicated, that's why I've come up with the simplest of templates for getting started on any front end projects.

The simplest of React-Redux template w/ React-router to help you get started with your frontend!.

This project features: 
**Express**, **Webpack**, **React**, **Redux** and **React-Router**

*Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, but remember we are trying to keep it as simple as possible, so any newbie can get started*
